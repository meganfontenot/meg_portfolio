## Bio
My name is Megan Fontenot and I am currently a Section Lead at Lambda School. I am an enthusiastic coder and programmer, and enjoy using my skills to contribute to the exciting technological advances that my product teams develop while ensuring they meet the required goals and deadlines in their sprints. 

I graduated from Lambda School’s full-stack Web Development curriculum in 2019. While in school, I learned the essentials of full-stack development as well as how to uphold an agile life cycle to ensure efficient development. 

I took a contract position at Lambda School in student leadership directly after graduation and was promoted to my current position in January of 2020. I am obsessed with all things product development and I spend my free time as a hobby writer and teaching other people how to code. I enjoy watching sci-fi movies (the cheesier, the better), binge reading whole series’ of books, and counting down the months until the next Marvel movie.
